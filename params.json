{"name":"SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task: <br> Morphological Reinflection","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome\r\nThe SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is \r\nmorphological reinflection. The goal, roughly\r\nstated, is to fill out a morphological paradigm (generally a nominal, adjectival or verbal inflection table)\r\ngiven some incomplete representation of the whole paradigm.\r\nThis area of computational morphology has received a flurry of attention recently\r\nin the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),\r\nDurett an DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015), _inter alia_).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Morphological Reinflection – A Brief Introduction\r\nIn many of the world's languages words change their form to express different syntactic\r\nand semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final \r\n\"s\", as in \"model\" → \"models\". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable \r\nof generating the correct inflections (consider \"wug\" → \"wugs\"), making these processes\r\nhighly productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed _inflection_ (often _conjugation_ when referring to verbs and _declension_ when referring to nouns).\r\nIn English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English\r\nsubstantives only distinguish singular and plural. \r\nBut many of the world's languages\r\nexhibit a high degree of inflection, making this a hard computational problem.\r\nIn Polish, for example, a single verb can have over a 100 forms! This sort of linguistic\r\nproductivity creates data sparsity problems for most other NLP tasks. With this shared task, we hope to\r\nmake progress in the community's ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.\r\n\r\n## Shared Task Philosophy\r\nA primary motivation behind this shared task is to spread\r\ninterest in computational morphology. In comparison \r\nto computational efforts in syntax and semantics, morphology\r\nreceives far less attention. This is in part because\r\nresearchers often work on English, a inflectionally impoverished\r\nlanguage, but also because there are fewer standardized resources. \r\nWith this in mind, we designed our first shared task to be\r\nboth useful, but also _easily accessible_ to researchers\r\nand students who have previously considered the area. Additionally,\r\nall resources required for this shared task will be open source, that is\r\navailable to everyone for free. \r\n\r\n### Task 1 – Reranking Reinflection\r\nThe first task we consider is reranking of reinflection.\r\nThe goal is to learn function that reinflects\r\na word form to another word form in the same paradigm. For instance,\r\nin English the system may be given \"eating\" and told to generate the past participle,\r\nwhich is \"eaten\". The goal of this task is to be relatively easy and\r\nhave a lower barrier to entry. We will provide\r\neach system with a set of word forms, their structured morphological\r\ntag, i.e, as described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015), and the structured\r\nmorphological tag of the _target word form_. Additionally, each system\r\nis given a set of candidates to chose among allowing this task to\r\nperform with simpler classifiers. \r\n\r\n* [Train](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task1/train)\r\n* [Dev](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task1/dev)\r\n* Test\r\n\r\n### Task 2 – Lemma to Full Paradigm\r\nThe second task is to generate a full paradigm from a lemma. This is\r\nthe task introduced in Durrett and DeNero (2013). \r\nThis setting is by far the easiest and a variety\r\nof researched, e.g., Hulden et al. (2014), and Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015),\r\nhave achieved developed high-performance systems. \r\n\r\n* [Train](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting1/train)\r\n* [Dev](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting1/dev)\r\n* Test\r\n\r\n### Task 3 – Slot to Full Paradigm\r\nThe third task is generating the full paradigm\r\nfrom an arbitrary word form in the paradigm. This is very similar\r\nto the task introduced in Dreyer and Eisner (2009), \r\nwith the exception that we will never give a system\r\nmore than one word form from which to generalize.\r\nTo be more concrete, the training data will consist of\r\npairs of word forms labeled with their structured tag\r\nand corresponding complete paradigm. The word form will be a slot sampled\r\nuniformly at random from the paradigm.\r\n\r\n* [Train](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting2/train)\r\n* [Dev](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting2/dev)\r\n* Test\r\n\r\n### Task 4 – Slot to Full Paradigm++\r\nThe fourth task is a variational of the third task with two small twists: we will\r\n(i) not provide the structured tag with the word form in the training or \r\ntest data and (ii) the training data will have incomplete paradigms, i.e., only\r\na subset of the slots will be given to train on. Both of these conditions\r\nrepresent noise that one should expect to find in the \"wild\", where data is often\r\nunlabeled and missing. In short, we would like to make computational morphological systems\r\nrobust. \r\n\r\n* [Train](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting3/train)\r\n* [Dev](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting3/dev)\r\n* Test\r\n\r\n## The Languages\r\nIn our selection of languages, we have sought a representative\r\nsample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).\r\nWe chose the following 8 languages: Spanish, German, Finnish, Russian, Turkish, Greenlandic, Navajo and Armenian.\r\nAll of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional\r\nprocessing at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). The data are formatted according to the schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).\r\n\r\n* **Spanish**: Spanish is a Romance language, branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. \r\n\r\n* **German:** German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.\r\n\r\n* **Finnish:** Finnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4 million speakers.\r\n\r\n* **Russian:** Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.\r\n\r\n* **Turkish:** Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.\r\n\r\n* **Greenlandic:** Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.\r\n\r\n* **Navajo:** Navajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.\r\n\r\n* **Armenian:** The Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\nWe will evaluate using accuracy at both the form level and the entire paradigm level, following\r\nDurrett and DeNero (2013). We will distributed evaluation scripts ahead of time for use\r\non the development data. In the case of polysemy, we will consider all answers correct. To give an example,\r\nthe English verb \"to hang\" has two correct past tenses: \"hung\" and \"hanged\", whose usage depends on the object\r\nof the verb. If a system predicts either one of this forms correctly, then we will consider it correct. \r\n\r\n## External Resources\r\nIn order to ensure a level playing field, we insist that only\r\nexternal resources listed below be used in the competing\r\nsystems. We may further ask for ablation studies regarding\r\nthese resources. \r\n\r\n* We will provide a large monolingual corpus for each language. We require\r\nthat systems do not use any additional corpus resources other than the ones provided.\r\n* To  \r\n* be\r\n* Determined\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bibliography\r\n\r\n* Greg Durrett, John DeNero.
