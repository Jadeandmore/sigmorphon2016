{"name":"SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task: Paradigm Completion","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome\r\nThe SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is \r\nmorphological paradigm completion. The goal, roughly\r\nstated, is to fill out a morphological paradigm, \r\na nominal or verbal inflection table,\r\ngiven some incomplete representation of the whole paradigm,\r\ne.g., the lemma or a partial (potentially noisy) set of\r\nslots of the paradigm. This area of computational\r\nmorphology has received a flurry of attention recently\r\nin the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),\r\nDurett an DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai and Kondrak (2015), _inter alia_).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Paradigm Completion – A Brief Introduction\r\nIn many of the world's languages words change their form to express different syntactic\r\nand semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final \r\n\"s\", as in \"model\" → \"models\". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable \r\nof generating the correct inflections (consider \"wug\" → \"wugs\"), making these processes\r\nhighly productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed _inflection_ (often _conjugation_ when referring to verb and _declension_ when referring to nouns).\r\nIn English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English\r\nsubstantives only distinguish singular and plural. \r\nBut many of the world's languages\r\nexhibit a high degree of inflection making this a hard computational problem.\r\nIn Polish, for example, a single verb can have over a 100 forms! This sort of linguistic\r\nproductivity creates data sparsity problems. With this shared task, we hope to\r\nmake a dent in our ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.\r\n\r\n### The Languages\r\nIn our selection of languages, we have sought a representative\r\nsample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).\r\nAll of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional\r\nprocessing at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at[Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)\r\nand formatted according to schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).\r\n\r\n## Spanish\r\nSpanish is a Romance language, branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. \r\n\r\n## German\r\nGerman is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.\r\n\r\n## Finnish\r\nFinnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n## Russian\r\nRussian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.\r\n\r\n## Turkish\r\nTurkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.\r\n\r\n## Greenlandic \r\nGreenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.\r\n\r\n## Navajo \r\n\r\nNavajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.\r\n\r\n## Armenian\r\n\r\nThe Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shared Task Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\n## Task 1 — Reranking Paradigms\r\nThe first task we consider is reranking\r\n\r\n## Task 2 — Full Paradigm Generation\r\n# Track 1 — Lemma to Full Paradigm\r\n# Track 2 — Slot to Full Paradigm\r\n# Track 3 — Slot to Full Paradigm++\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bibliography\r\n\r\n* Greg Durrett, John DeNero.
