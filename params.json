{"name":"SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task: Paradigm Completion","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome\r\nThe SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is \r\nmorphological paradigm completion. The goal, roughly\r\nstated, is to fill out a morphological paradigm, \r\na nominal or verbal inflection table,\r\ngiven some incomplete representation of the whole paradigm,\r\ne.g., the lemma or a partial (potentially noisy) set of\r\nslots of the paradigm. This area of computational\r\nmorphology has received a flurry of attention recently\r\nin the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),\r\nDurett an DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai and Kondrak (2015), _inter alia_).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Paradigm Completion – A Brief Introduction\r\nIn many of the world's languages words change their form to express different syntactic\r\nand semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final \r\n\"s\", as in \"model\" → \"models\". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable \r\nof generating the correct inflections (consider \"wug\" → \"wugs\"), making these processes\r\nhighly productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed _inflection_ (often _conjugation_ when referring to verb and _declension_ when referring to nouns).\r\nIn English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English\r\nsubstantives only distinguish singular and plural. \r\nBut many of the world's languages\r\nexhibit a high degree of inflection making this a hard computational problem.\r\nIn Polish, for example, a single verb can have over a 100 forms! This sort of linguistic\r\nproductivity creates data sparsity problems. With this shared task, we hope to\r\nmake a dent in our ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.\r\n\r\n### The Languages\r\nIn our selection of languages, we have sought a representative\r\nsample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).\r\nAll of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional\r\nprocessing at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) as [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)\r\nand formatted according to schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).\r\n\r\n### Task 1 — Reranking Paradigms\r\nThe first task\r\n\r\n### Task 2 — Full Paradigm Generation\r\n## Track 1 — Lemma to Full Paradigm\r\n## Track 2 — Slot to Full Paradigm\r\n## Track 3 — Slot to Full Paradigm++\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bibliography\r\n\r\n* Greg Durrett, John DeNero.
