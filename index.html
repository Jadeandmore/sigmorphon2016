<p>The SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is 
morphological reinflection. The goal is to generate a specified
inflected form of word, given a different form. For instance,
we ask systems to generate the gerund "running" from the past tense "ran". In the general
form, we may ask for <em>all</em> possible inflected forms. This task is known as paradigm completion and
has received a flurry of attention in the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),
Durett and DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015), <em>inter alia</em>).</p>

<a id="morphological-inflection--a-brief-introduction" class="anchor" href="#morphological-inflection--a-brief-introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Morphological Inflection – A Brief Introduction</h2>

<p>In many of the world's languages, words change their form to express different syntactic
and semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final 
"s", as in "model" → "models". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable 
of generating the correct inflections (consider "wug" → "wugs"), that is, the processes
are productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed <em>inflection</em> (often <em>conjugation</em> when referring to verbs and <em>declension</em> when referring to nouns).
In English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English
substantives only distinguish singular and plural. 
But many of the world's languages exhibit a high degree of inflection, making this a hard computational problem.
In Polish, for example, a single verb can have over 100 forms! This sort of linguistic
productivity creates data sparsity problems for most other NLP tasks. With this shared task, we hope to
make progress in the community's ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.</p>

<h2>
<a id="task-1--lemma-to-inflection" class="anchor" href="#task-1--lemma-to-inflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 1 – Lemma to Inflection</h2>

<p>The first task is to generate a target inflection from the lemma. This is
the task introduced in Durrett and DeNero (2013). This setting is rather well-researched, 
e.g., Hulden et al. (2014), and Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015),
have achieved developed high-performance systems. Following Durrett and DeNero (2013), 
we will evaluate at both the level of the individual inflection as well as the paradigm level</p>

<h3>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h3>

<p>The systems will be given lemma and a target morphological tag.</p>

<p><code>Source Form: "run"</code>
<code>Target Tag: "Gerund"</code></p>

<p><code>Output: "running"</code></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task1/setting1/train">Train</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task1/setting1/dev">Dev</a></li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="task-2--partial-to-full-paradigm" class="anchor" href="#task-2--partial-to-full-paradigm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 2 – Partial to Full Paradigm</h2>

<p>The second task is generating reinflections from multiple inflected
forms. This is very similar to the task introduced in Dreyer and Eisner (2009). 
We will give each system of a partial subset of the paradigm with its morphological tag and 
evaluate against held-out forms in the paradigm. This sort of prediction
is useful in languages with multiple stems -- in Spanish, for instance, the
verb to put "poner" has an irregular past stem, which is difficult to predict. 
However, when given one inflected past tense form prediction becomes easier.
Note we will not always provide the lemma.</p>

<p><code>Source Forms: ["poner" | infinitive], ["puso" | 3rd Person Preterite]
</code>Target Tag: "2nd Person Preterite "`</p>

<p><code>Output: "pusiste"</code></p>

<ul>

<li>Test</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="additional-details" class="anchor" href="#additional-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will always provide the system with the total number of slots and their correspond tags for the complete paradigms.</li>
<li>For all languages we are working with orthographic strings, and not phonological strings (pronunciations). </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="evaluation" class="anchor" href="#evaluation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation</h2>

<p>We will evaluate using accuracy at both the form level and exact match at the entire paradigm level, following
Durrett and DeNero (2013). We will distribute evaluation scripts ahead of time for use
on the development data. In the case of polysemy, we will consider all answers correct. To give an example,
the English verb "to hang" has two correct past tenses: "hung" and "hanged", whose usage depends on the object
of the verb. If a system predicts either one of this forms correctly, then we will consider it correct. </p>

<h2>
<a id="shared-task-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#shared-task-philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shared Task Philosophy</h2>

<p>A primary motivation behind this shared task is to spread
interest in computational morphology. In comparison 
to computational efforts in syntax and semantics, morphology
receives far less attention. This is in part because
researchers often work on English, a inflectionally impoverished
language, but also because there are fewer standardized resources. 
With this in mind, we designed our first shared task not only to be useful, but also <em>easily accessible</em> to researchers
and students who have previously considered the area. Additionally,
all resources required for this shared task will be open source, that is,
available to everyone for free. </p>

<h2>
<a id="the-languages" class="anchor" href="#the-languages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Languages</h2>

<p>In our selection of languages, we have sought a representative
sample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).
We chose the following 8 languages: Spanish, German, Finnish, Russian, Turkish, Greenlandic, Navajo and Armenian.
All of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional
processing at the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The data are formatted according to the schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spanish</strong>: Spanish is a language of the Romance branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>German:</strong> German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finnish:</strong> Finnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4 million speakers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Russian:</strong> Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turkish:</strong> Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Greenlandic:</strong> Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navajo:</strong> Navajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Armenian:</strong> The Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.</p></li>
