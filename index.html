<p>The SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is 
morphological paradigm completion. The goal, roughly
stated, is to fill out a morphological paradigm, 
a nominal or verbal inflection table,
given some incomplete representation of the whole paradigm,
e.g., the lemma or a partial (potentially noisy) set of
slots of the paradigm. This area of computational
morphology has received a flurry of attention recently
in the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),
Durett an DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai and Kondrak (2015), <em>inter alia</em>).</p>

<p>In many of the world's languages words change their form to express different syntactic
and semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final 
"s", as in "model" → "models". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable 
of generating the correct inflections (consider "wug" → "wugs"), making these processes
highly productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed <em>inflection</em> (often <em>conjugation</em> when referring to verb and <em>declension</em> when referring to nouns).
In English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English
substantives only distinguish singular and plural. 
But many of the world's languages
exhibit a high degree of inflection making this a hard computational problem.
In Polish, for example, a single verb can have over a 100 forms! This sort of linguistic
productivity creates data sparsity problems. With this shared task, we hope to
make a dent in our ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.</p>

<a id="the-languages" class="anchor" href="#the-languages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Languages</h3>

<p>In our selection of languages, we have sought a representative
sample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).
All of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional
processing at the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at<a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>
and formatted according to schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spanish</strong>: Spanish is a Romance language, branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>German:</strong> German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finnish:</strong> Finnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4 million speakers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Russian:</strong> Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>Turkish: *</em>Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Greenlandic:</strong> Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navajo:</strong> Navajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>Armenian: *</em>The Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.</p></li>
