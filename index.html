<p>The SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is 
morphological reinflection. The goal is to generate a specified
inflected form of word given a different inflected form. For instance,
we could ask systems to generate the gerund "running" from the past tense "ran". In the general
case, we may ask for <em>all</em> possible inflected forms. This task is known as paradigm completion and
has received a flurry of attention in the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),
Durett and DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai et al. (2015), <em>inter alia</em>).</p>

<p>In many of the world's languages, words change their form to express different syntactic
and semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final 
"s", as in "model" → "models". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable 
of generating the correct inflections (consider "wug" → "wugs"), that is, the processes
are productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed <em>inflection</em> (often <em>conjugation</em> when referring to verbs and <em>declension</em> when referring to nouns). "Reinflection"
is then case where we take an already inflected form and put a different inflection. 
In English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English
substantives only distinguish singular and plural. 
But many of the world's languages exhibit a high degree of inflection, a hard computational problem 
as well as a linguistically interesting one. 
In Polish, for example, a single verb can have over 100 forms! This sort of linguistic
productivity creates data sparsity problems for most other NLP tasks. With this shared task, we hope to
make progress in the community's ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.</p>

<h2>
<a id="task-1--inflection" class="anchor" href="#task-1--inflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 1 – Inflection</h2>

<p>The first task is to generate a target inflection from the lemma. This is
the task performed in Durrett and DeNero (2013). This setting is rather well-researched, 
e.g., Hulden et al. (2014) and Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015)
have achieved developed high-performance systems. Following Durrett and DeNero (2013), 
we will evaluate at both the level of the individual inflection as well as the paradigm level.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Source Lemma: run</code></p>

<p><code>Target Tag: Gerund</code></p>

<p><code>Output: running</code></p>
</blockquote>

<li>Test</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="task-2--reinflection" class="anchor" href="#task-2--reinflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 2 – Reinflection</h2>

<p>The second task is generating reinflections from a single <em>inflected</em>
form for which we provide the morphological tag. 
This is very similar to the task introduced in Dreyer and Eisner (2009), except
that we will limit the input inflection to a single form. The primary
difference between Task 2 and Task 1 in that the system will be responsible for
mapping between <em>any</em> <em>two</em> slots in the paradigm. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Source Form: ran</code></p>

<p><code>Source Tag: Past</code></p>

<p><code>Target Tag: Gerund</code></p>

<p><code>Output: running</code></p>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<a id="task-3--unlabeled-reinflection" class="anchor" href="#task-3--unlabeled-reinflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 3 – Unlabeled Reinflection</h2>

<p>The third task is generating a reinflection <em>without</em> knowing
the structured morphological tag. In this version of the task
it may make sense to leverage monolingual corpora in the language to
get a sense of the morphology through distributional information.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Source Form: ran</code></p>

<p><code>Target Tag: Gerund</code></p>

<p><code>Output: running</code></p>

<a id="additional-details-and-possible-strategies" class="anchor" href="#additional-details-and-possible-strategies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Details and Possible Strategies</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will always provide the system with the total number of slots and their corresponding tags for the complete paradigms.</li>
<li>For all languages we are working with orthographic strings, and not phonological strings (pronunciations). </li>
<li>All of these are sequence-to-sequence mapping problems.  If you have a general method for learning such mappings, you can simply throw it at all of these tasks.</li>
<li>You can solve the tasks in sequence.  For instance, reduce Task 2 to Task 1 by recovering an inflected form's lemma given its tag and then reduce Task 3 to Task 2 by recovering an inflected form's tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="bonus-resources" class="anchor" href="#bonus-resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bonus Resources</h2>

<p>In order to ensure a level playing field, we insist that only
external resources listed below be used in the competing
systems. We may further ask for ablation studies regarding
these resources. </p>

<ul>
<li>We will provide a large monolingual corpus for each language. We require
that systems do not use any additional corpus resources other than the ones provided.</li>
<li>Each task is permitted to make use of the training data for the other tasks in the same language.  For example:
Task 1 could use Task 2's data for multi-task learning (i.e., learning the Past → Gerund mapping might help with learning the Lemma → Gerund mapping). Task 2 could use Task 3's data as additional incomplete training data. Task 3 could use Task 2's data as additional super-complete training data, to help construct and train a model with latent tags.</li>
<li>All tasks could use Task 2's data to help bootstrap an unsupervised tagger for the monolingual corpus.
Each task is permitted to make use of all test inputs for all tasks in the same language (transductive learning). </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="evaluation" class="anchor" href="#evaluation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation</h2>

<p>We will evaluate using accuracy at both the form level and exact match at the entire paradigm level, following
Durrett and DeNero (2013). We will distribute evaluation scripts ahead of time for use
on the development data. In the case of polysemy, we will consider all answers correct. To give an example,
the English verb "to hang" has two correct past tenses: "hung" and "hanged", whose usage depends on the object
of the verb. If a system predicts either one of this forms correctly, then we will consider it correct. If you use a bonus resource, we request that you submit an additional version of your system that does not not use that resource, so that we can measure its benefit.</p>

<a id="dates" class="anchor" href="#dates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Training data will be released October 1, 2015</li>
<li>Evaluation will take place TBD Spring, 2016</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="the-languages" class="anchor" href="#the-languages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Languages</h2>

<p>In our selection of languages, we have sought a representative
sample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).
We chose the following 10 languages: Spanish, German, Finnish, Russian, Turkish, Greenlandic, Navajo and Armenian
and an additional two surprise languages whose identity and training data will only be revealed come evaluation time.
All of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional
processing at the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The data are formatted according to the schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spanish</strong>: Spanish is a language of the Romance branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>German:</strong> German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finnish:</strong> Finnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4 million speakers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Russian:</strong> Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turkish:</strong> Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Greenlandic:</strong> Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navajo:</strong> Navajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Armenian:</strong> The Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.</p></li>
