## Welcome
The SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task is 
morphological paradigm completion. The goal, roughly
stated, is to fill out a morphological paradigm (a nominal or verbal inflection table)
given some incomplete representation of the whole paradigm,
e.g., the lemma or a partial (potentially noisy) set of
slots of the paradigm. This area of computational
morphology has received a flurry of attention recently
in the NLP literature (Dreyer and Eisner (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011),
Durett an DeNero (2013), Hulden et al. (2014), Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015), _inter alia_).


## Paradigm Completion – A Brief Introduction
In many of the world's languages words change their form to express different syntactic
and semantic relationships in a structured fashion. For instance, English generally overtly marks the plural with a final 
"s", as in "model" → "models". Even for novel words, native speakers are perfectly capable 
of generating the correct inflections (consider "wug" → "wugs"), making these processes
highly productive. The act of modifying word forms to express these relationships is termed _inflection_ (often _conjugation_ when referring to verbs and _declension_ when referring to nouns).
In English, this task is relatively uninteresting, e.g., English
substantives only distinguish singular and plural. 
But many of the world's languages
exhibit a high degree of inflection making this a hard computational problem.
In Polish, for example, a single verb can have over a 100 forms! This sort of linguistic
productivity creates data sparsity problems for most other NLP tasks. With this shared task, we hope to
make progress in the community's ability to automate this aspect of computational morphology.

## Shared Task Philosophy
A primary motivation behind this shared task is to spread
interest in computational morphology. In comparison 
to computational efforts in syntax and semantics, morphology
receives far less attention. This is in part because
researchers often work on English, a inflectionally impoverished
language, but also because there are fewer standardized resources. 
With this in mind, we designed our first shared task to be
both useful, but also _easily accessible_ to researchers
and students who have previously considered the area. Additionally,
all resources required for this shared task will be open source, that is
available to everyone for free. 

### Task 1 – Reranking Reinflection
The first task we consider is reranking of reinflection.
The goal is to be able to learn function that reinflects
a word form to another word form in the same paradigm. For instance,
in English the system may be given "eating" and told to generate the past participle,
which is "eaten". The goal of this task is to be relatively easy and
have a lower barrier to entry. We will provide
each system with a set of word forms, their structured morphological
tag, i.e, as described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015), and the structured
morphological tag of the _target word form_. Additionally, each system
is given a set of candidates to chose among allowing this task to
perform with simpler classifiers.

### Task 2 – Full Paradigm Generation
The second task is full-blown paradigm completion. The goal
here is to generate the _full paradigm_ from a given 
word form in the paradigm in various settings. We have
ordered the settings in order of their difficult and we expect
systems to be able compete in all three tracks.

#### Setting 1 – Lemma to Full Paradigm
The first setting we consider is generating
a full paradigm from a lemma. This is
the task introduced in Durrett and DeNero (2013). 
This setting is by far the easiest and a variety
of researched, e.g., Hulden et al. (2014), and Nicolai, Cherry and Kondrak (2015),
have achieved developed high-performance systems.

* Test

#### Setting 2 – Slot to Full Paradigm
The second task is generating the full paradigm
from an arbitrary word form in the paradigm. This is very similar
to the task introduced in Dreyer and Eisner (2009), 
with the exception that we will never give a system
more than one word form from which to generalize.
To be more concrete, the training data will consist of
pairs of word forms labeled with their structured tag
and corresponding complete paradigm. The word form will be a slot sampled
uniformly at random from the paradigm.

* [Dev](https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/task2/setting2/dev)
* Test

#### Setting 3 – Slot to Full Paradigm++
The third track is a variation of Track 2 with two small twists: we will
(i) not provide the structured tag with the word form in the training or 
test data and (ii) the training data will have incomplete paradigms, i.e., only
a subset of the slots will be given to train on. Both of these conditions
represent noise that one should expect to find in the "wild", where data is often
unlabeled and missing. In short, we would like to make computational morphological systems
robust.

## The Languages
In our selection of languages, we have sought a representative
sample of the world's languages (albeit biased to those with rich inflection).
We chose the following 8 languages: Spanish, German, Finnish, Russian, Turkish, Greenlandic, Navajo and Armenian.
All of the data has been scraped from Wiktionary and undergone additional
processing at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). The data are formatted according to the schema described in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015).

* **Spanish**: Spanish is a Romance language, branch of the larger Indo-European family, that originated in the Castile region of Spain. More than 400 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it second only to Mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide. 

* **German:** German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 90 million people in central Europe.

* **Finnish:** Finnish is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It has 5.4 million speakers.

* **Russian:** Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. It has 150 million native speakers and 260 speakers total.

* **Turkish:** Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 63 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia.

* **Greenlandic:** Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit people in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut. The main dialect, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009.

* **Navajo:** Navajo is a language of the Athabaskan branch of the Na-Dené family, by which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation political area. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.

* **Armenian:** The Armenian language is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. In total the language has 6 million speakers.
